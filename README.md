# ðŸ¤¯ Advanced react redux boilerplate ðŸ¤¯
### Using:
### [React Router v4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router),<br>[React-router-redux v5](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-redux),<br>[SemanticUi React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), <br>[React Redux v5](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)

Scripts (I put npm but my heart belongs to yarn)
---------------
- `npm install` to download dependencies and run a postinstall build
- `npm run dev` for starting a dev server with hot-reloading
- `npm run build` for building production ready webpack build
- `npm start` for launching production server
